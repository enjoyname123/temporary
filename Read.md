## Slide 6: Real-World Examples of Color Psychology

Companies don’t just pick colors randomly—they consult experts in color psychology to make sure their choices create the right impact in public.

Take Google, for example as here. Its multicolored logo represents creativity, inclusivity, and innovation, making the brand feel approachable. Then there is Coca-Cola, whose bold red conveys energy, excitement, and happiness, reinforcing its joyful and refreshing brand image. And even some other brands like Facebook sticks to blue to symbolize trust, McDonald's uses red and yellow to create a sense of energy and urgency to eat, Starbucks uses green to reflect freshness and a sence relaxation, Apple uses for white and gray, emphasizing simplicity and innovation.

Colors are not only used for decoration purposes but have a meaning and purpose.

## Slide 6.5: Application of Color Psychology in Real Life

As Tejeshwar said, colors influence our mood and choices, and as Venkateshwari said, it is a part of branding. But apart from that, color psychology is applied in so many other areas.

Like Interior Designing: Hospitals use blue and green for the soothing effect, and restaurants usually use warm colors to stimulate urgency.

Fashion & Personal Branding: The colors we wear influence how people perceive us—black can signal authority, while lighter tones can make someone seem more approachable.

## Slide 7: Conclusion & Final Thoughts

To sum it up:

Colors are more than just decoration—they influence emotions and behaviors. And Businesses use color psychology to shape brand identity and consumer perception. Whether in marketing, design, or daily life, color choices matter.

As Wassily Kandinsky said: ```Color is a power that directly influences the soul.```
